# Singer-Most-Wanted

This repo is intended to keep track of the Singer connectors that we, as a community, would like to see built.


If you are looking for a connector that doesn't exist yet or you'd like to see it migrated over to the [Meltano Singer SDK](https://sdk.meltano.com/en/latest/), here's what you should do:

1. Check out [MeltanoHub](https://hub.meltano.com/singer/) to make sure it doesn't already exist.
1. Sometimes connectors haven't been added to MeltanoHub yet, so do a quick search on GitHub/Lab to see if one exists already.
If you find one, please also [make an issue](https://gitlab.com/meltano/hub/-/issues/new?issue) on MeltanoHub so we get it added!
1. Check if an [issue](https://github.com/MeltanoLabs/Singer-Most-Wanted/issues) is already open for the connector you're looking for.
If so, jump into the issue discussion and see what the status is or how you can help!
1. Add a [new issue](https://github.com/MeltanoLabs/Singer-Most-Wanted/issues/new) to this repo with a title like "tap-x" or "tap-x to SDK" if its for migrating.
